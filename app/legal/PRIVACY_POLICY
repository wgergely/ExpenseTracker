ExpenseTracker Privacy Policy

Last Updated: May 3, 2025


TL;DR

ExpenseTracker doesn't collect or store your personal data. Everything stays on your device or your Google account. No
data is transmitted or shared with anyone else.


POLICY

This Privacy Policy explains how ExpenseTracker ("the app") handles your data and outlines your rights. By using the
app, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.


Introduction and Overview

ExpenseTracker is an open source desktop app that helps you monitor expenses using data from a connected Google Sheets
document. The app does not collect or share personal data. It operates entirely on your device, using Google’s official
APIs with your permission. This policy details minimal data handling, compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and includes
disclaimers of liability.


No Personal Data Collected or Transmitted

The app does not collect, log, or transmit any personal data or personally identifiable information (PII). The app
contains no tracking or analytics tools. The app does not transmit any information to external servers except Google
Sheets when explicitly requested by you. The app does not sell, trade, or share any data. All data processing is local
on your device and in your Google Sheets. The app does store a cached, unencrypted copy of your Google Sheets data for
local use. This data is never sent to any external servers or shared with any third parties. The app does not use
cookies or other tracking technologies.


Google Sheets Access via OAuth and the official Google Python API

The app uses Google’s OAuth 2.0 to securely access data in Google Sheets. You authorize it directly through Google, and
your credentials are never exposed to the developer. Only necessary permissions are requested, and OAuth tokens are
stored locally on your device. You can revoke access anytime via Google Account settings. The app fully complies with
Google’s policies.


Local Data Storage and Security

All app data, including Google OAuth tokens, is stored securely on your local device using standard OS-provided
mechanisms.


Optional Use of Custom Google Credentials


You may use your own Google Cloud Project credentials and Client Secret instead of the default shipping one.

If using the default credentials, Google provides anonymous aggregate metrics to the developer, such as the
number of API requests but no personal or identifiable data and no aggregate data is never shared externally.


Third-Party Services

**Google Sheets API (Google LLC):** Governed by Google’s terms and privacy policy.
**No other external APIs:** No additional third-party integrations.
**Open-source libraries:** Included libraries do not collect data.


Your Privacy Rights and Choices

Due to no data collection, most privacy rights are inherently respected.


GDPR (EU)

No personal data is collected or processed, thus aligning fully with GDPR principles.


CCPA (California)

The app collects no personal data, thus inherently complying with CCPA.


Other Jurisdictions

Compliance with privacy laws globally by default due to no data collection.


Disclaimer of Warranties and Liability

ExpenseTracker is provided "AS IS" without any warranties or liability for damages or data loss.


Changes to This Privacy Policy

This policy may be updated. Users will be notified through appropriate channels. Your continued use signifies acceptance
 of changes.
