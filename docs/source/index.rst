-------

If you use Google Sheets to track personal expenses, you might have thougth at one point, huh,
wouldn't it be nice to have a dedicated app that can visualize my spreadsheet? I know, you didn't think that.
But I did, and I built one, and you're looking at it!

Before you get your hopes up, ExpenseTracker is limited and boots only a limited feature set.


What does it do?
++++++++++++++++

| ‚úÖ Fetches data from Google Sheets and display expenses by period and category
| ‚úÖ Displays expenses by period
| ‚úÖ You can save preset, to allow switching between multiple sources and or insights
| ‚úÖ Browse and edit category transactions
| ‚úÖ Basic data visualization
| ‚úÖ Arrange, exclude and customize categories


What it doesn't do:
+++++++++++++++++++

| ‚ùå Source data editing isn't fully supported (only category editing)



Quick Start
===========

Download and install the latest release (Windows only, sorry!) from the releases page:

| üîΩ `Latest Release on Github <https://https://github.com/wgergely/ExpenseTracker/releases/>`_


| üîò Google Cloud Project 

You'll have to set up a Google Cloud Project and an OAuth 2.0 client ID to access the Google Sheets API.
The process is a little cumbersome, but without this data cannot be fetched from SPreadhseet sources.
