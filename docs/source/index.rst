**ExpenseTracker is a personal financce desktop app for visualizing expenses stored in a Google Sheets.**


-------

If you are like me, and use Google Sheets to track personal expenses, you might have thougth at one point, huh,
wouldn't it be nice to have a dedicated app that can visualize my spreadsheet? I know, sheets does charts but it is a bit clunky.
Anyhow, I did think that and I did built one, and you're looking at it!

Before you get your hopes up, ExpenseTracker is a pretty basic and boots only a limited feature set.

What does it do?
++++++++++++++++

| ‚úÖ Fetches data from Google Sheets and display expenses by period and category
| ‚úÖ Fitler data by period
| ‚úÖ Manages presets, to allow switching between multiple sources and or insights modes
| ‚úÖ browse transactions by category
| ‚úÖ edit transaction categories
| ‚úÖ display data in simple charts
| ‚úÖ arrange, exclude and customize categories


What it doesn't do:
+++++++++++++++++++

| ‚ùå doesn't (yet) support editing source data


Quick Start
===========


| üîΩ `Latest Release on Github <https://https://github.com/wgergely/ExpenseTracker/releases/>`_



Download and install the latest release.

The app needs a Google Cloud project and an OAuth 2.0 client ID to access the Google Sheets API.
It is a bit cumbersome to set up but is necessary to fetch data from your Google Sheet sources.
